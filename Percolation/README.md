This project is developed with intellij, simply import this project folder Percolation in intellij and you are good to go. For arguments, please edit configurations in intellij.

I used the java file provided in princeton website instead of algs4.jar. Since they are manually implemented, you have to test it in the intellij.(If you use the javac, they would cause error for some comments in the algorithm file.)


Happy coding :)
